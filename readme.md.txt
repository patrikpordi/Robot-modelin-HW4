First of all, please use the HTML file instead of the PDF, it is easier to look at the values.
The file is a jupyter notebook when you open it via Anaconda you can run each cell individually.
Currently, the 3D plot is generated at the end.
It opens in a new window, where you can rotate it around(you need the newest matplotlib version for it), if you do not have it
comment out the "equal" part from it in the aspect ratio or use the 2d plot that is commented out.
